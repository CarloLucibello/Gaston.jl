Gaston

A gnuplot interface for the julia language.

1. Setup

Put gaston.jl and all gaston-*.jl files somewhere convenient. Then, you may cd
to that directory and start julia there, or do

push(LOAD_PATH, "/path/to/gaston/jl")

Then, load the program with

	require("gaston.jl")

2. Tests/Demo

To run a demo (which also tests all of Gaston's capabilites), do

	require("gaston_demo.jl")
	demo()

This will create a series of figures that illustrate the current capabilites
of the program. The same file also shows how to create different types
of plots.

To run the tests, do

	require("gaston_test.jl")
	run_tests()

A series of tests will run. On the console, each test is reported as passed or
failed, and a summary is printed at the end. All tests should pass; otherwise,
please file an issue.

3. Documentation

Detailed documentation is included in a LaTeX file. To build it, cd into the
gaston/doc directory and run 'make'. You need to have XeLaTeX installed. A PDF
file called 'gastondoc.tex' will be created.
