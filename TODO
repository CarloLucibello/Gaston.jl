To do file for Gaston

(In no particular order)

* add support for x11 terminal, as a fallback for people without wxwindows
* add support for pdfcairo (or pngcairo?) for basic printing support
* add support for rgbimage (plotstyle is identified but not acted on)
* add as much error checking as reasonable, to minimise risk of gnuplot
  barfing on us on misconfigured plots
* review type annotations to see if they can be improved
* finish documentation
* add histogram support (done)
* add histogram fill support

Document and code the following rules and constraints:

- in each 2-d curve, x, y must be the same size
	* if there is error data, it must also be the same size
- there can be only one image per figure
- in each 3-d curve, matrix Z must be of size x*y
- plotstyles accept different configurations
- what others...
