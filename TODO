To do file for Gaston

v 0.3:

* add as much error checking as possible, to minimise risk of gnuplot
  barfing on us on misconfigured plots
* Document and code the following rules and constraints:
	- in each 2-d curve, x, y must be the same size
		* if there is error data, it must also be the same size
	- in each 3-d curve, matrix Z must be of size y times x
	- plotstyles accept different configurations
	- the input to figure() must be a natural number
	- others?
* add histogram fill support
* remove the restriction to have only one image per figure
* add high-level, 'quick plot' functions, similar to Octave's
* change type names to conform to Julia conventions (no underscores)
* improve documentation

v 0.4 and later:

* improve high-level, 'quick plot' functions, similar to Octave's
* improve demo() and unit tests as needed
* add support for x11 terminal, as a fallback for people without wxwindows
* add support for pdfcairo (or pngcairo?) for basic print-to-file support
* review type annotations to see if they can be improved
* review code organization
* review which other plot styles may be supported
* add unit tests that try to break the program
* add suport for setting the colormap
* improve documentation
