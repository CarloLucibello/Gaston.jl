To do file for Gaston

(In no particular order)

* add support for x11 terminal, as a fallback for people without wxwindows
* add support for pdfcairo (or pngcairo?) for basic printing support
* add support for rgbimage (plotstyle is identified but not acted on)
* add as much error checking as reasonable, to minimise risk of gnuplot
  barfing on us on misconfigured plots
* review type annotations to see if they can be improved
* finish documentation
